# The Void: AI Research Framework
Welcome to The Void, where we take AI research seriously, but not ourselves! The Void is a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, buzzword-compliant AI research framework written in C++. Why C++, you ask? Because we like to live dangerously.

## Features
* Fast: It's C++. Need we say more?
* Fun: Who said AI research can't be fun? With The Void, you'll be having a blast while your models are crashing and burning.
* Frustrating: We guarantee you'll be pulling your hair out within the first five minutes. If not, you're probably doing it wrong.


## Usage
Here's a quick example of how to use The Void to compute the cross-entropy loss:

```cpp
#include "the_void.h"

int main() {
    // Create some predictions and true labels
    std::vector<double> predictions = {0.7, 0.2, 0.1};
    std::vector<double> true_labels = {1.0, 0.0, 0.0};

    // Compute the cross-entropy loss
    double loss = TheVoid::cross_entropy_loss(predictions, true_labels);

    // Print the loss
    std::cout << "Cross-entropy loss: " << loss << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

```
To compile and run this program, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ -o my_program my_program.cpp -lthe_void
./my_program
```
